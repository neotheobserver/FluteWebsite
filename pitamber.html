                <p>I come from a family of instrument maker and I am personally devoted to crafting top quality Bansuri, commonly known as Flute.
                    My one and only aim is to build top quality flute made out of top quality Bamboo. The
                    Bamboo I use is very rare and was traditionally used to make different wind pipe instrument
                    but has been in decline recently. However, since my focus is on quality I put my best effort
                    to get the top quality bamboo; hence,the resulting flute is guranteed to be of high quality 
                    producing a melodious sound of the respective scale.</p>

                <p>On the top of producing high quality sound, it also has sturdy makeup, making it resistant
                    against different extreme condition as well as external impact. Also, the aroma of the bamboo itself
                    would be intoxicating, almost as if you burned an incense, so it is definitely something to look after.
            
                </p>
                <p>The Hindu God Lord Krishna is traditionally considered a master of the bamboo flute. We have all
                    heard legends of Krishna enticing 1600 gopinis with the help of melodious tone from his bansuri. So, I would like to encourage and request
                    you to buy one as soon as you can and get into your own journey with this divine instrument.
